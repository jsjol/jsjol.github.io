My overarching goal is to **accelerate scientific and technological progress using machine learning and optimization**. To exemplify what that can mean more concretely, I highlight a few examples of ongoing research projects below. Before moving to Uppsala University, I mainly worked on applications to medical imaging and radiotherapy planning. These are also described in more detail below.
