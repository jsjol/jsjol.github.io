I'm a [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/) Fellow, [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) member, and assistant professor in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en). My research interests are primarily in **machine learning** and **optimization**.

Prior to joining Uppsala University, I was a senior research scientist at the radiotherapy company [Elekta](https://www.elekta.com) where I was also an industrial PhD student affiliated with Link√∂ping University.

At Elekta, I did research on machine learning, optimization and medical image analysis (MRI in particular) which resulted in more than 25 patent applications. I'm particularly proud of the work on dose optimization which formed the basis for [Leksell Gamma Knife Lightning](https://www.elekta.com/radiosurgery/leksell-gamma-knife-lightning/).

## Open positions
We're hiring two PhD students in machine learning for breast cancer! One will focus on [multimodal machine learning](https://uu.varbi.com/en/what:job/jobID:852518/), with me as the main supervisor, and the other on [causal machine learning](https://uu.varbi.com/en/what:job/jobID:852394/), with Dave Zachariah as the main supervisor.

The students will work in the larger WASP-DDLS NEST project [AID4BC](https://aid4bc.org/), which aims to advance data-driven multimodal methods to enable true precision diagnostics throughout the breast cancer pathway.

## Working with me
I'm always on the lookout for curious and self-driven people as well as exciting collaborations (with both industry and academia) that align with my [research vision](/research/). If that may be you, please [get in touch](/contact/)!
