I'm a [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/) assistant professor in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en). My research interests are primarily in **machine learning** and **optimization**.

Prior to joining Uppsala University, I was a senior research scientist at the radiotherapy company [Elekta](www.elekta.com) where I was also an industrial PhD student affiliated with Linköping University.

At Elekta, I did research on machine learning, optimization and medical image analysis (MRI in particular) which resulted in more than 25 patent applications. I'm particularly proud of the work on dose optimization which formed the basis for [Leksell Gamma Knife Lightning](https://www.elekta.com/radiosurgery/leksell-gamma-knife-lightning/).

## PhD opening
I currently have an opening for a PhD student in generative machine learning and statistical inference together with [Fredrik Lindsten](https://lindsten.netlify.app/) at Linköping University. You can [read more and apply here](https://liu.se/en/work-at-liu/vacancies/24191).


## Working with me
I'm always on the lookout for curious and self-driven people as well as exciting collaborations (with both industry and academia) that align with my [research vision](/research/). If that may be you, please [get in touch](/contact/)!
