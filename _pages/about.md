I'm a [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/) assistant professor in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at Uppsala University. My research interests are primarily in **machine learning** and **optimization**.

Prior to joining Uppsala University, I was a senior research scientist at the radiotherapy company [Elekta](www.elekta.com) where I was also an industrial PhD student affiliated with Link√∂ping University.

At Elekta, I did research on machine learning, optimization and medical image analysis (MRI in particular) which resulted in more than 25 patent applications. I'm particularly proud of my work on dose optimization which formed the basis for [Leksell Gamma Knife Lightning](https://www.elekta.com/radiosurgery/leksell-gamma-knife-lightning/).
