I'm a [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/) assistant professor in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at Uppsala University. My research interests are primarily in **machine learning** and **optimization**.

Prior to joining Uppsala University, I was a senior research scientist at the radiotherapy company [Elekta](www.elekta.com) where I was also an industrial PhD student affiliated with LinkÃ¶ping University.

At Elekta, I did research on machine learning, optimization and medical image analysis (MRI in particular) which resulted in more than 25 patent applications. I'm particularly proud of my work on dose optimization which formed the basis for [Leksell Gamma Knife Lightning](https://www.elekta.com/radiosurgery/leksell-gamma-knife-lightning/).

## ðŸ•¬ Open position ðŸ•¬
We have an opening for a postdoc who wants to solve large-scale convex optimization problems that arise in radiotherapy planning. Read more and apply [here](https://uu.varbi.com/en/what:job/jobID:608101). The deadline is May 3rd.


## Working with me
I'm always on the lookout for curious and self-driven people as well as exciting collaborations (with both industry and academia) that align with my [research vision](/research/). If that may be you, please [get in touch](/contact/)!
